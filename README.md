### Behavior
[Insert code of conduct link here once decided]

However, In Short:
- be nice
- don't discriminate
- work together
- understand people make mistakes

### Code

- Using should not require understanding
- Disclose complexity progressively
- Use sugar to make code easier to read (not to write)
- Only infer on top of what is already explicit
- The fewer ways a value needs to be checked, the better
- Well written code won't be well written until it is done, so add comments
- Run ``python -c "import this"``
- If you can't read it, re-write it (cause neither can I)
